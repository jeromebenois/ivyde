This documentation is defining every steps that needs to be accomplished when releasing IvyDE.
In this doc, the released version is denoted as $VERSION, so it HAVE to be replaced in the command line argument accordingly. There is also some $LOGIN which is referencing your login on the Apache machines.

<h1>Prepare</h1>

<h2>Jira</h2>

First in <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/IVYDE">Jira</a> make sure that no more issues are opened for the target release.

<h2>Release branch</h2>

Some modifications of the branch are need to do the release. So a new branch is needed:
<pre>
svn copy https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/ivy/ivyde/trunk \
           https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/ivy/ivyde/branches/$VERSION \
      -m "Creating a release branch for IvyDE $VERSION"
</pre>

and then checkout it:
<pre>
svn co https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/ivy/ivyde/branches/$VERSION ivyde-$VERSION
</pre>

<h2>Documentation release</h2>

The documentation have to specify the correct version number:
In the files:
<ul>
<li>doc/template.html</li>
</ul>
The header should look like this
<code>
<title>${title} | IvyDE $VERSION Documentation</title>
</code>

<h2>Release notes</h2>

Go edit the RELEASE_NOTES.txt files. There are two things to change, marked by some <tt>TODO WHEN RELEASING</tt>:
<ul>
    <li>the list of contributors should be filled according to the "thanks to" in the CHANGE.txt file</li>
    <li>the list of bug/features fixed in the release should be filled from the one in the CHANGE.txt file</li>
</ul>

Edit the IvyDE doc and add a new page just under the root of the documentation tree:
<ul>
    <li>Child page title: Release Notes</li>
    <li>Child page path: release-notes</li>
</ul>

As content in that doc, copy paste the content of the RELEASE_NOTES.txt file.
Then you should improve the style of the page by adding some h1, h2, remove unwanted line break. Normally you shouldn't care about the http link or the jira issue, xooki will take care of them.

<h2>Commit your change</h2>

Don't forget to commit the changes you've done into the release branch.

<h1>Building</h1>

Make sure you have a proper working copy with a <tt>svn status</tt>. You should have no modification.

Then launch the build:
<pre>ant /release clean dist -DbaseLocation=/home/me/...../eclipse/</pre>

And sign the artifacts:
<pre>./signArtifacts.sh</pre>

Then it is time to tag the release as soon as you are happy with your artifacts:

<code>svn copy https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/ivy/ivyde/branches/$VERSION \
           https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/ivy/ivyde/tags/$VERSION \
      -m "Tag IvyDE release $VERSION"
</code>

And don't forget to set the svn:external on doc/xooki to a fixed revision. Edit the svn:external property on the folder doc/xooki in the tag and set it to the revision of the commit of the tag. It should look like:
<pre>
xooki -r790212 https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/ivy/site/xooki/
</pre>

And commit that modifiaction.

<h1>Prepare the updatesite</h1>

The instructions to build the updatesite are there:
http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/trunk/dev/updatesite.html

<h1>Vote for the released artifacts</h1>

It is recommended to publish the distribution artifacts and the updatesite in your public_html on people.apache.org directory so not only committers can test it.

On people.apache.org, create your "staging" directory:
<pre>mkdir ~/public_html/ivyde-$VERSION/</pre>
And then the copy:
<pre>scp dist/* $LOGIN@people.apache.org:/home/$LOGIN/public_html/ivyde-$VERSION/</pre>
It is recommended to also deploy a staging updatesite there. See <a href="http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/trunk/dev/updatesite.html">that page</a> to know how to proceed.

And launch the vote on the ant-dev mailing list:
<code>
Subject: [VOTE] IvyDE $VERSION Release

I have built a release candidate for IvyDE $VERSION

You can download the distribution from this URL: http://people.apache.org/~$LOGIN/ivyde-$VERSION/

And a staging update site has been setup there: http://people.apache.org/~$LOGIN/staging/updatesite

Do you vote for the release of these binaries?

[ ] Yes
[ ] No

Regards,

$ME, IvyDE $VERSION release manager
</code>

Note: this <a href="http://ant.apache.org/bylaws.html">page</a> is defining when and how a release can be accepted.

<h1>Deployment</h1>

<h2>Publish the artifacts</h2>

The binaries have to be pushed with their signatures and checksums in the apache dist directory. On people.apache.org:
<pre>
cp -R ~/public_html/ivyde-$VERSION /www/www.apache.org/dist/ant/ivyde/$VERSION
</pre>

<h2>Deploy the updatesite</h2>

Follow the instructions of that page: http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/latest-milestone/dev/updatesite.html#deployment

<h1>Update the documentation</h1>

<h2>Update the table of content</h2>

The table of content needs to be updated so that the last documentation point to that new release.

First we need to update the external links. In svn/site/ivyde/history:
<pre>svn pe svn:externals .</pre>
And: <ul><li>update latest-milestone:
<code>
latest-milestone https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/ivy/ivyde/tags/$VERSION/doc </code>
</li>
<li>add an entry:
<code>$VERSION https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/ant/ivy/ivyde/tags/$VERSION/doc </code></li>
</ul>

Then we need to edit svn/site/ivyde/toc.json:
<ul>
<li>add the following data to the correct abstract node:
<pre>
            {
                "title":"$VERSION",
                "importRoot":"history/$VERSION",
                "importNode":"index"
            }
</pre>
</li>
<li>update the title of the latest-milestone history entry:
<pre>
            "title":"Documentation ($VERSION)"
</pre>
</li></ul>

Then svn update your working copy (to retrieve the new history branch).

<h2>Update the download page</h2>

In the page svn/site/ivyde/download.html change every reference of the old version to the new one.

<h2>Deploy</h2>

Commit your changes, and proceed to the full deployment of the website (regenerate every page as the toc changed: <tt>ant /all generate-site-ivyde</tt>).

<h1>Post release tasks</h1>

<h2>Jira</h2>

Update the <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/project/ManageVersions.jspa?pid=12310640">IvyDE Jira project</a>: mark the version as released.

<h2>Bump the version</h2>

Update the versions needs to be updated in the following files:
<ul>
<li>build.properties (edit the qualifier)</li>
<li>org.apache.ivyde.eclipse/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF</li>
<li>org.apache.ivyde.feature/feature.xml</li>
</ul>
