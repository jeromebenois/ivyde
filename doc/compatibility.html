<h2>Upgrading/Downgrading</h2>

This version is compatible with every earlier Apache release (since 2.0.0.alpha1). Any upgrade of IvyDE should work without any worries.

The reverse is not true, downgrading is not supported and may break your configuration

<h2>Dependency on Ivy</h2>

IvyDE expects to be used with a version 2.0 or superior of Ivy.

<h2>Eclipse integration</h2>

IvyDE has been maintained to be compatible with Eclipse 3.2 and has been successfully tested and used with Eclipse 3.3 and 3.4.

<h2>JVM compability</h2>

IvyDE has been kept compatible with Java 1.4.
